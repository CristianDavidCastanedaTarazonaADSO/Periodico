            <p>Ehrhardt and her opponent,<br> Republican Earnest Leonard, have been<br> pounding the pavement to introduce<br> themselves to voters in a re-drawn<br> District 107, which includes the north-<br> ern half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen-<br> tral and east Dallas, and a northern<br> swath east of central expressway jutting<br> up to the LBJ Freeway.<br> Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse-<br> ment of the political action committee<br> of Lesbian/Gay Political Coalition of<br> Dallas. Leonard received the endorse-<br> ment of Log Cabin Republicans of<br> Dallas.
                The candidates' get-out-the-vote<br> efforts are kicking into high gear for<br> election day. With statistics and maps of<br> every square inch of the district, it<br> seems, Ehrhardt plans to have an army<br> of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting<br> sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera-<br> ture, in addition to running a phone<br> bank to remind people to vote and<br> coordinate transportation to the polls.<br>
                Ehrhardt said surprise its the most<br>
                common response she gets when<br>
                knocking on doors. Most people say<br>
                they have never met their representa-<br>
                tive in the Texas Legislature before, a<br>
                situation which she said she finds frus-<br>
                trating, given her efforts to get out in<br>
                the district.<br>
                Gay and lesbian issues will almost<br> certainly be featured in the 1997 legisla-<br> tive session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights<br> Lobby of Texas plans to offer several<br> proposals, as well as to fight off expect-<br> ed anti-gay bills:<br>
                Hate crimes. Both candidates for<br> District 107 have pledged to support a<br> hate crimes bill, which would stiffen<br> criminal penalties for crimes motivated<br> by religious, racial, or anti-gay preju-<br> dice. Leonard said he generally sup-<br> ports anti-crime measures. Ehrhardt is<br> widely credited with being a leader in<br> last session's attempt to pass a revised<br> hate crimes bill, which narrowly failed<br> in the House.<br>
                Employment Non-Discrimination.<br> Leonard opposes a gay civil rights bill<br> to outlaw job discrimination against<br> gays and lesbians, saying such mea-<br> sures inevitably lead to "frivolous law-<br> suits," but he has pledged a policy of</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contenedor6">
            <p>non-discrimination for his own staff.<br> Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill,<br> arguing that employment security is<br> one of the most important social justice<br> questions facing the community.<br> Observers say such a bill has no chance<br> of passing during the Texas<br> Legislature's next session.<br>
                Same-gender marriage. Leonard<br> has said he would vote for a bill ban-<br> ning same-gender marriage in Texas.<br> He said he sees no need to expand the<br> family code to provide state recognition<br> for same-gender unions. Ehrhardt<br> opposes the measure, which is expected<br> to be introduced by anti-gay conserva-<br> tives. Analysts expect a marriage bill<br> forbidding same-gender unions to pass<br> during the next legislative session. The<br> question, they say, is how much anti-<br> gay language will be included in the<br> measure.<br>
                AIDS funding. Both candidates<br> have said they support increased fund-<br> ing for the AIDS Drug Assistance<br> Program, which provides HIV medica-<br> tions to low-income Texans, although<br> Leonard stipulated that he would need<br> to be convinced that the money was<br> helping people and not "feeding the<br> bureaucracy." Recent pharmaceutical<br> advances, such as the protease<br> inhibitors, have wildly escalated treat-<br> ment costs and lobbyists say an addi-<br> tional $14 million will be needed from<br> the state to fully fund the Texas pro-<br> gram.<br>
                Given Ehrhardt's long history of<br> involvement for gay and lesbian issues,<br> many Democratic activists have<br> expressed shock that the Log Cabin<br> Republicans-Dallas have backed<br> Leonard, endorsing the GOP candidate,<br> hosting a fundraiser-reception for him<br> and providing campaign volunteers.<br>
                "They [Log Cabin] really need to<br> examine what their motivations are,"<br> said Peter Brooks, co-chair of the LGRL<br> board. "If the Republicans control [the<br> Texas House or Senate], we can kiss<br> goodbye trying to get anything through."<br>
                Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per-<br> cent voting record for gay issues, and.<br> cited her assistance during the last ses-<br> sion and her persistence in lobbying<br> other legislators to support the hate<br> crimes bill.</p>
